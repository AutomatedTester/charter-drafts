    <h2>Scope</h2>

    <h3>APIs for use in automated testing of Web applications</h3>

    <p>The scope of the Browser Testing and Tools Working Group
    includes APIs for the purpose of automating testing of Web applications
    running in browsers—for example, to simulate user actions such as
    clicking links, entering text, and submitting forms.

    <h3>APIs for use in troubleshooting and debugging of Web applications</h3>
    <p>For the purpose of troubleshooting and debugging Web applications,
      many Web browsers provide either a built-in set of “developer tools”.

    <p>The Browser Testing and Tools Working Group will produce a specification
      for a Remote Debug Protocol, as well as consider any other potential APIs
      useful in performing troubleshooting and debugging of Web applications.

    <div>
      <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
      <p>In order to advance to  <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Proposed
Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected
to have at least two independent implementations of each of feature defined
in the specification.</p>
      <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any
known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and
end users.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="deliverables">
    <h2>
      Deliverables
    </h2>
      <p>
        The working group will deliver the following W3C normative specification:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt id="webdriver" class="spec"><a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html">Web Driver API Level 2</a></dt>
      <dd>
<p>
Provides methods that allow automated simulation of user actions, such as
clicking links, entering text, and submitting forms.
      </dd>
      <dd>
<p>
      <b>Expected completion:</b> 30 September 2018
      </dd>
      <dt id="remote_debug" class=spec><a href="#">Remote Debug Protocol Level 1</a></dt>
      <dd><p>Provides methods that allow the debugging of web applications, from
      any number of IDEs.
      </dd>
      <dd><b>Expected completion:</b> 30 September 2018</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>

  </section>

  <section id="coordination">
    <h2>Coordination</h2>
    <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>

    <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/WebPlatform/WG/">Web Platform Working Group</a></li>
      <li><a href="/Style/CSS/">CSS Working Group</a></li>
      <li><a href="/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group</a>
        (given that there is a possibility of relevant accessibility considerations in APIs for browser testing)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="participation">
    <h2 id="participation">
      Participation
    </h2>
    <p>
      To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the W3C Patent Policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="communication">
    <h2>
      Communication
    </h2>
    <p id="public">
      Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/testing/browser/">Browser Testing and Tools Working Group home page.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This group primarily conducts its technical work in the following two places:
<ul>
<li>the public mailing list
<a href="mailto:public-browser-tools-testing@w3.org">public-browser-tools-testing@w3.org</a>
      (<a
      href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-browser-tools-testing/">archive</a>)
<li>the <code>#webdriver</code> IRC channel on <code>irc.w3.org</code> for webdriver
  related topics or <code>#testing</code> for remote debug protocol related topics.
</ul>
      The public is invited to post messages to that mailing list and
      to participate in discussions on that IRC channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not anticipated that the group will conduct any
regularly-scheduled teleconferences but may conduct occasional
teleconferences on an as-needed basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="decisions">
    <h2>
      Decision Policy
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
    <p>
       However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

      A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

      If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
    </p>
    <p>
      All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
    </p>
    <p>
      This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
